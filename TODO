BORED? DO THESE THINGS:
=======================

`Make a .gitignore file.
`Set up .zsh/ directory with source files.
`Eat something.  No... coffee is NOT food; put that back and get some real food.
`Work on yr dwm config.  It's been feeling neglected and depressed lately.
`Scratch that, learn what Haskell is all about, and work on an Xmonad config instead.
`Make a script to install dotfiles/configs.
`Get up, take a walk/bike-ride.  It's nice outside.
`Turn on, tune in, and SLACK OFF!
